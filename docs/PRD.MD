| :----------------- | :------------ |
| **Version:**       | 1.0           |
| **Date:**          | July 19, 2025 |
| **Status:**        | Proposed      |
| **Author:**        | Gemini        |
| **Project Owner:** | User          |

### **1\. Introduction**

#### **1.1. Project Vision**

ChronoLog is envisioned as a frictionless, "set-it-and-forget-it" version control system for creative and iterative artifacts, starting with AI prompts. It will function as an ambient, local-first tool that automatically records the history of files without requiring any manual intervention from the user, thus preserving creative velocity while ensuring complete historical verifiability.

#### **1.2. Problem Statement**

Prompt engineering and other creative workflows involve rapid, high-velocity iteration. Traditional version control systems like Git impose significant cognitive overhead and procedural friction (e.g., manual commits, branching), which disrupts the creative process. Creators need a safety net to track their experiments, compare versions, and revert to previous states, but without the ceremony of a formal VCS. There is currently no lightweight, local-first tool that provides automatic, implicit versioning as a background process.

#### **1.3. Target Audience**

The primary audience for Phase 1 is **technical and power users** who are comfortable with the command line. This includes:

- AI/ML Engineers and Researchers
- Prompt Engineers
- Developers who frequently iterate on configuration files or scripts
- Technical Writers

#### **1.4. Scope**

**In Scope for Phase 1:**

- A command-line interface (CLI) tool that can be installed and run locally.
- A background daemon/service that automatically monitors specified local directories for file changes.
- An "implicit commit" mechanism that automatically versions a file upon a debounced save event.
- Core CLI commands to initialize the system, view version history, display the content of a specific version, compare two versions, and revert a file to a previous version.
- All data and version history will be stored exclusively on the user's local machine.

**Out of Scope for Phase 1:**

- Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), including IDE or browser extensions.
- Cloud synchronization, sharing, or any other network-based features.
- User authentication or multi-user support.
- AI-powered features like semantic analysis or automated annotations.
- Handling of non-text or binary files.

### **2\. Goals and Success Metrics**

#### **2.1. Project Goals**

- **Goal 1:** Deliver a stable, functional CLI tool that provides automatic, local versioning for text-based files.
- **Goal 2:** Eliminate the friction of manual version control for the target audience's iterative workflows.
- **Goal 3:** Establish a robust and extensible core engine that will serve as the foundation for future phases (IDE integration, etc.).

#### **2.2. Success Metrics**

- **Metric 1:** The background daemon uses less than 5% of a single CPU core and less than 100MB of RAM during idle monitoring.
- **Metric 2:** The time from a file save event to the completion of a version commit is less than 500ms on average.
- **Metric 3:** Successful installation and initialization (chronolog init) by 10/10 internal testers on all three target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Metric 4:** Zero data loss incidents reported during a 2-week internal testing period involving continuous file edits.

### **3\. User Requirements and Features**

#### **3.1. Feature: System Initialization**

- **User Story:** As a user, I want a simple command to initialize ChronoLog in my project directory so that the system can start tracking my files automatically.
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - A command chronolog init must be available.
  - Running this command shall create a hidden directory named .chronolog in the current working directory.
  - The .chronolog directory will contain the necessary storage structure (e.g., an objects directory and an SQLite database file).
  - The command will start the background watcher process to monitor the current directory and its subdirectories.
  - If the directory is already initialized, the command should inform the user and exit gracefully.

#### **3.2. Feature: View Version History**

- **User Story:** As a user, I want to view a chronological list of all the saved versions of a specific file so that I can understand its history and identify key changes.
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - A command chronolog log \<file_path\> must be available.
  - The output must be a reverse-chronological list of all recorded versions for the specified file.
  - Each entry in the log must display, at a minimum: a unique version hash, the timestamp of the change, and any user-added annotations.

#### **3.3. Feature: Show Version Content**

- **User Story:** As a user, I want to view the full content of a specific historical version of a file so that I can inspect its exact state at that point in time.
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - A command chronolog show \<version_hash\> must be available.
  - The command shall print the complete, unmodified content of the file associated with the given version hash to standard output.

#### **3.4. Feature: Compare Versions (Diff)**

- **User Story:** As a user, I want to see the specific differences between two versions of a file so that I can easily track what has been added, removed, or changed.
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - A command chronolog diff \<hash1\> \<hash2\> must be available.
  - The command shall output a colorized, line-by-line comparison of the two specified versions in a standard "unified diff" format.
  - The command should also support comparing a historical version with the current, un-versioned state of the file in the working directory.

#### **3.5. Feature: Revert to a Previous Version**

- **User Story:** As a user, I want to revert a file back to a specific historical version so that I can undo changes or recover a previous state.
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - A command chronolog checkout \<version_hash\> \<file_path\> must be available.
  - This command will overwrite the contents of the specified file in the working directory with the contents from the specified version hash.
  - This revert action itself will be recorded as a new version in the history, with its parent being the version that was checked out, to ensure no history is lost.

### **4\. System and Technical Requirements**

#### **4.1. Architecture**

The system will consist of two main components:

1. **Background Daemon:** A long-running process that implements the Watcher and Storage layers. It performs the file monitoring and implicit commits.
2. **CLI:** The user-facing interface that communicates with the storage system to execute user commands.

#### **4.2. Technology Stack**

- **Language:** Python 3.9+
- **File Monitoring:** watchdog library
- **CLI Framework:** Click or Typer
- **Database:** SQLite (using the built-in sqlite3 module)

#### **4.3. Performance**

- The background daemon must be lightweight and have minimal impact on system performance.
- File hashing and database operations must be performant enough to not introduce noticeable lag during file save operations.

#### **4.4. Platform Support**

- The system must be fully functional on the latest stable versions of:
  - Windows 10/11
  - macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel)
  - Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ equivalent)

#### **4.5. Directory Structure**

Upon init, the following structure will be created:

.  
├── .chronolog/  
│ ├── objects/ \# Content-addressable storage for file content  
│ └── history.db \# SQLite database for metadata and version graph  
└── my_prompt.txt

### **5\. Assumptions and Dependencies**

- **Assumption 1:** Users have Python 3.9+ and pip installed on their systems.
- **Assumption 2:** Users have the necessary permissions to read/write files in the directories they wish to monitor and to run background processes.
- **Dependency 1:** The project will depend on the watchdog and click/typer Python packages, which will be managed via a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml file.

### **6\. Risks and Mitigation**

| Risk                                                           | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cross-platform compatibility issues with the file watcher.** | Medium     | High   | Rigorous testing on all three target OSs. Use a mature, well-maintained library like watchdog. Allocate specific time for platform-specific bug fixing.                                                                 |
| **High resource consumption by the background daemon.**        | Medium     | Medium | Implement efficient event debouncing. Optimize database queries. Perform load testing by simulating rapid file edits.                                                                                                   |
| **Race conditions or data corruption in the database.**        | Low        | High   | Use SQLite's transaction features to ensure atomic writes. Implement a robust error handling and logging mechanism.                                                                                                     |
| **Incorrectly handling file renames or deletions.**            | Medium     | Medium | The initial scope will focus on file modifications. A clear strategy for handling renames/deletions will be defined, even if implementation is deferred. For Phase 1, the watcher may simply record a "deletion" event. |
